# Recursion 
Recursion is a process where a function solves a problem by calling itself with a smaller or simpler version of the same problem.

This process must have two key parts:

Base Case: The simplest possible version of the problem that the function can solve directly, which stops the recursion.

Recursive Step: The part of the function that calls itself with a modified input, bringing it closer to the base case.
